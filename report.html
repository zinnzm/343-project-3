<body>
  <p>This site is designed to create programming "memes".</p>
  <p>The "memes" are created using two seperate API's, for the jokes we used <a
      href="https://v2.jokeapi.dev/">JokeAPI</a> and for the meme images we used <a
      href="https://imgflip.com/api">Imgflip API</a>. In the top right corner is a search bar that can be used to search
    for jokes that may contain specific words in it. Since it is a programming joke generator CS terms are usually
    better to search. For filtering we allow the user to select the joke to be displayed. The Imgflip API is then called
    with GET request to receive an image and a POST request to allow for the text to be placed on the image. This allows
    the user to interact with the results of searching for a joke.</p>
